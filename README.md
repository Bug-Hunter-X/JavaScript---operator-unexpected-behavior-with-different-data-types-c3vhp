# JavaScript + operator unexpected behavior with different data types This repository demonstrates the unexpected behavior of the + operator in JavaScript when used with different data types. The + operator performs string concatenation when one of the operands is a string, which can lead to unexpected results when working with numbers and strings.  The bug.js file shows the unexpected behavior, and bugSolution.js provides a solution using type checking.
